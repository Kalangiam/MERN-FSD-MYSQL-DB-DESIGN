1. I created two variables in two folders
    - users : list of sample user Data
    - Mentors : 2 sample mentors 

2. Mentors hold all the details of their users 
3. Made simple into JSON array of objects.
4. The date can be retrieved by calling the date object inside the array
5. mysql commands for the questions asked are typed in the folder and executed
6. An excel sheet is attched as how the rough draft design created.
7. Tested with mysql workbench , a screenshot is attached.  
8. By extending this , we could be able to build a large zen portal with organized Database
